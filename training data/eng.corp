That ignorance of each other's ways and lives has been a common cause, throughout the history of mankind, of that suspicion and mistrust between the peoples of the world through which their differences have all too often broken into war;
That the great and terrible war which has now ended was a war made possible by the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men and races;
(b) In selecting its representative on the Executive Board, the Member of the Executive Board shall endeavour to appoint a person qualified in one or more of the fields of competence of UNESCO and with the necessary experience and capacity to fulfil the administrative and executive duties of the Board.

8/11. Human rights and extreme poverty
The Human Rights Council,
Recalling that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international covenants on human rights, the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his or her civil and political rights,
Recalling its resolutions 5/1 on institution building of the Human Rights Council and 5/2 on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Council of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her duties in accordance with these resolutions and their annexes thereto,
1. The tasks of the present Code are as follows: the protection of the rights and freedoms of man and citizen, property, public order and public security, the environment, and the constitutional system of the Russian Federation against criminal encroachment, the maintenance of peace and security of mankind, and also the prevention of crimes.
1. It shall not be deemed a crime when harm is inflicted in the state of necessary defence to an attacking person, i.e. in the case of protection of the personality and the rights of defendant or other persons, law-protected interests of the society or the state against a socially-dangerous attack if such an attack involved a violence threatening the life of the defendant or another person or an immediate threat of use of such a violence.
3. The right to necessary defence equally belongs to all persons, irrespective of their professional or other special training background and position. 
1.

1. Punishment is a measure of state compulsion assigned by a court's judgement. 
Punishment shall be applied to a person who has been found guilty of the commission of a crime. 
It consists of the depreciation or restriction of the rights and freedoms of this person, as provided for by this Code.
b) deprivation of the right to hold specified offices or to engage in specified activities;
2. Fines and deprivation of the right to hold specified offices or to engage in specified activity shall be applicable both as basic and additional penalties.
Article 47. 
Deprivation of the Right to Hold Specified Offices or to Engage in Specified Activities.
1. Deprivation of the right to hold specified offices or to engage in specified activities consists of the prohibition to hold offices in the civil service and local self-government bodies, or to engage in a professional or any other activity.
2. Deprivation of the right to hold specified offices or to engage in specified activities shall be established for a term of one year to five years as a basic penalty, or for a term of six months to three years as an additional penalty.
Recalling also all previous resolutions on the issue of human rights and extreme poverty adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, as well as its own relevant resolutions including Council resolutions 2/2 and 7/27,
Bearing in mind the resolutions of the General Assembly on human rights and extreme poverty, and the importance they attach to giving persons living in extreme poverty the wherewithal to organize and participate in all aspects of political, economic and social life, 
Stressing also that respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and programmes to fight extreme poverty at the local and national levels,

Chapter 19. 
Crimes Against the Constitutional Rights and Freedoms of Man and Citizen 
Article 136. 
Violation of the Equality of Human and Civil Rights and Freedoms
1. Violation of the equality of human and civil rights and freedoms, based on sex, race, nationality, language, origin, property or official status, place or residence, attitude to religion, convictions, or affiliation with public associations which has caused harm to the rights and legally-protected interests of individuals,
shall be punishable by a fine in the amount of 500 to 800 minimum wages, or salaries or in the amount of the wage or salary, or any other income of the convicted person for a period of five to eight months, or by deprivation of the right to hold specified offices or to engage in specified activities for a term of two to five years, or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to five years. 
1. Illegal collection or spreading of information about the private life of a person which constitutes his personal or family secrets, without his consent, or the distribution of this information in a public speech, in a publicly performed work, or in the mass media, if these deeds have been committed out of mercenary motives or any other personal interests, and have caused harm to the rights and legally-protected interests of individuals,
(a) Promote the prevention of trafficking in persons in all its forms and the adoption of measures to uphold and protect the human rights of victims;
(d) Identify and share best practices as well as challenges and obstacles in order to uphold and protect the human rights of the victims and to identify protection gaps in this regard;

(g) Work in close cooperation, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with other special procedures and subsidiary organs of the Council, relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms, including the Interagency Coordination Group on Trafficking in Persons, the treaty bodies and regional human rights mechanisms, as well as national human rights institutions and civil society and the private sector;
5. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure that the Special Rapporteur receives the resources necessary to enable him or her to discharge the mandate fully;
6. Requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit to the Council, at its ninth session, a report on the latest developments in the United Nations relating to combating trafficking in persons as well as on the activities of the Office on this issue, including by presenting the recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking developed by the Office;
The Human Rights Council,
Recalling the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including Article 1 that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood,
Recalling also the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including article 12, 
Article 147. 
Violation of Inventor's Rights and Patent Rights
Article 148. 
Obstruction of the Exercise of the Right of Liberty of Conscience and Religious Liberty
1. Swindling, that is, the stealing of other people's property or the acquisition of the right to other people's property by fraud or breach of trust,
1. Extortion, that is, the demand that other people's property or their right to property should be transferred, or that other acts of a property nature should be performed under threat of violence or of destruction or damage of other people's property, and also under the threat of dissemination of information that defames the victim or his relatives or of any other information which may cause substantial harm to the rights or legitimate interests of the victim or his relatives,

Taking note of the previous work done by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanism on discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, 
1. Affirms that persons affected by leprosy and their family members should be treated as individuals with dignity and are entitled to all basic human rights and fundamental freedoms under customary international law, relevant conventions and national constitutions and laws;
3. Requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to include the issue of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members as an important matter in its human rights education and awareness raising activities;
“deratting” means the procedure whereby health measures are taken to control or kill rodent vectors of human disease present in baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, facilities, goods and postal parcels at the point of entry;
“disinfection” means the procedure whereby health measures are taken to control or kill infectious agents on a human or animal body surface or in or on baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods and postal parcels by direct exposure to chemical or physical agents;
“disinsection” means the procedure whereby health measures are taken to control or kill the insect vectors of human diseases present in baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods and postal parcels;
(a) facilitation of the development, transfer and acquisition of technology, knowledge, skills, capacity and expertise related to tobacco control;
54. Stresses the importance of enhancing the public information capacity of the Department of Public Information in the field of peacekeeping operations and its role in the selection process of spokespersons for United Nations peacekeeping operations or missions, and, in this regard, encourages the Department to second spokespersons who have the necessary skills to fulfil the tasks of the operations or missions, taking into account the principle of equitable geographical distribution in accordance with Chapter XV, Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, and to consider views expressed, especially by host countries, when appropriate, in this regard;
57. The outlines of a possible United Nations peace operation often first appear when negotiators working toward a peace agreement contemplate United Nations implementation of that agreement. 
Although peace negotiators (peacemakers) may be skilled professionals in their craft, they are much less likely to know in detail the operational requirements of soldiers, police, relief providers or electoral advisers in United Nations field missions. 
Non-United Nations peacemakers may have even less knowledge of those requirements. 
Yet the Secretariat has, in recent years, found itself required to execute mandates that were developed elsewhere and delivered to it via the Security Council with but minor changes. 
140. The most experienced and seasoned of the group are now in limited supply, deployed in current missions, and many are at or near retirement. 
Many of those who remain lack the managerial skills or training required to effectively run the key administrative components of complex peace operations. 
Others' technical knowledge is dated. 
Thus, the Field Service's composition no longer matches all or many of the administrative and logistics support needs of the newer generation of peacekeeping operations. 
The Panel therefore encourages the urgent revision of the Field Service's composition and raison d'être, to better match the present and future demands of field operations, with particular emphasis on mid- to senior-level managers in key administrative and logistics areas. 
Staff development and training for this category of personnel, on a continual basis, should also be treated as a high priority, and the conditions of service should be revised to attract and retain the best candidates. 
29. In conditions of crisis within a country, when the Government requests or all parties consent, preventive deployment could help in a number of ways to alleviate suffering and to limit or control violence. 
Humanitarian assistance, impartially provided, could be of critical importance; assistance in maintaining security, whether through military, police or civilian personnel, could save lives and develop conditions of safety in which negotiations can be held; the United Nations could also help in conciliation efforts if this should be the wish of the parties.
In certain circumstances, the United Nations may well need to draw upon the specialized skills and resources of various parts of the United Nations system; such operations may also on occasion require the participation of non-governmental organizations. 
51. Member States are keen to participate in peace-keeping operations. 
Military observers and infantry are invariably available in the required numbers, but logistic units present a greater problem, as few armies can afford to spare such units for an extended period. 
Member States were requested in 1990 to state what military personnel they were in principle prepared to make available; few replied. 
I reiterate the request to all Member States to reply frankly and promptly. 
Stand-by arrangements should be confirmed, as appropriate, through exchanges of letters between the Secretariat and Member States concerning the kind and number of skilled personnel they will be prepared to offer the United Nations as the needs of new operations arise. 
Providing new and modern policing skills, such as community policing, and anti-drug, anti-corruption and anti-terrorist capacities;
We will encourage the provision of modern equipment appropriate to police services that receive training in such new skills.
In describing how to meet the challenge of prevention, we begin with development because it is the indispensable foundation for a collective security system that takes prevention seriously. 
It serves multiple functions. 
It helps combat the poverty, infectious disease and environmental degradation that kill millions and threaten human security. 
It is vital in helping States prevent or reverse the erosion of State capacity, which is crucial for meeting almost every class of threat. 
And it is part of a long-term strategy for preventing civil war and for addressing the environments in which both terrorism and organized crime flourish. 
19. Similarly, the security of the most affluent State can be held hostage to the ability of the poorest State to contain an emerging disease. 
Because international flight times are shorter than the incubation periods for many infectious diseases, any one of 700 million international airline passengers every year can be an unwitting global disease-carrier. 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to more than 8,000 people in 30 countries in three months, killing almost 700. 
The influenza pandemic of 1919 killed as many as 100 million people, far more than the First World War, over a period of a little more than a year. 
Today, a similar virus could kill tens of millions in a fraction of the time. 
36. Collective security institutions have proved particularly poor at meeting the challenge posed by large-scale, gross human rights abuses and genocide. 
This is a normative challenge to the United Nations: the concept of State and international responsibility to protect civilians from the effects of war and human rights abuses has yet to truly overcome the tension between the competing claims of sovereign inviolability and the right to intervene. 
It is also an operational challenge: the challenge of stopping a Government from killing its own civilians requires considerable military deployment capacity.
In describing how to meet the challenge of prevention, we begin with development because it is the indispensable foundation for a collective security system that takes prevention seriously. 
It serves multiple functions. 
It helps combat the poverty, infectious disease and environmental degradation that kill millions and threaten human security. 
It is vital in helping States prevent or reverse the erosion of State capacity, which is crucial for meeting almost every class of threat. 
And it is part of a long-term strategy for preventing civil war, and for addressing the environments in which both terrorism and organized crime flourish.

(xi) Killing or wounding treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army;
(ix) Killing or wounding treacherously a combatant adversary; 
Article 6 (a) Genocide by killing
[2] The term "killed" is interchangeable with the term "caused death".
1. The perpetrator killed one or more persons.
[7] The term "killed" is interchangeable with the term "caused death". 
This footnote applies to all elements which use either of these concepts.
1. The perpetrator killed one or more persons, including by inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population.
[8] The conduct could be committed by different methods of killing, either directly or indirectly.
2. The conduct constituted, or took place as part of, a mass killing of members of a civilian population.
[10] The term "as part of" would include the initial conduct in a mass killing.
War crime of wilful killing
1. The perpetrator killed one or more persons.
[31] The term "killed" is interchangeable with the term "caused death". 
This footnote applies to all elements which use either of these concepts.
2. The perpetrator threatened to kill, injure or continue to detain such person or persons.
War crime of killing or wounding a person hors de combat
160. This is not to say that the transition will be easy for developing countries, especially the very poor. 
Lack of resources and skills is part of the problem, inadequate basic infrastructure another, illiteracy and language a third, and, of course, there are concerns about privacy and content. 
Technical solutions will become available for many of these problems, including wireless access, and even simple automatic translation programmes, enabling us to communicate and engage in e-commerce across language barriers.
172. Rather than trying to freeze declining industries in place, which always fails in the long run, political leaders should make the case for upgrading skills through education and training, and for providing adjustment assistance. 
193. Wars since the 1990s have been mainly internal. 
They have been brutal, claiming more than 5 million lives. 
They have violated, not so much borders, as people. 
Humanitarian conventions have been routinely flouted, civilians and aid workers have become strategic targets, and children have been forced to become killers. 
Often driven by political ambition or greed, these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences. 
They are often sustained by external economic interests, and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market. 
237. I cannot here review the entire arms control spectrum. 
Instead, I focus on two categories of weapon that are of special concern: small arms and light weapons, because they currently kill most people in most wars; and nuclear weapons, because of their continuing terrifying potential for mass destruction.
266. Portents of this future are already visible. 
As the warming trend has accelerated, weather patterns have become more volatile and more extreme, while the severity of weather-related disasters has escalated. 
The cost of natural disasters in 1998 alone exceeded the cost of all such disasters in the entire decade of the 1980s (see fig. 11). 
Tens of thousands of mostly poor people were killed that year, and an estimated 25 million “environmental refugees” were forced from their homes. 
The damage wrought by these disasters has been exacerbated by unsustainable environmental practices and the fact that more and more poor people have little choice but to live in harm’s way -- on flood plains and unstable hillsides and in unsafe buildings.
279. Unsafe water and poor sanitation cause an estimated 80 per cent of all diseases in the developing world. 
The annual death toll exceeds 5 million, 10 times the number killed in wars, on average, each year. 
More than half of the victims are children. 
No single measure would do more to reduce disease and save lives in the developing world than bringing safe water and adequate sanitation to all. 
206. On 1 July 2004, Louise Arbour took up her responsibilities as High Commissioner following the General Assembly's endorsement of my decision to appoint her to that post. 
For the past year, the Office of the High Commissioner has been ably led by Bertrand Ramcharan, following the tragic death on 19 August 2003 of Sergio Vieira de Mello, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and my Special Representative in Iraq, who was killed, along with 21 colleagues, in a terrorist attack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad. 
I take this opportunity to put on record the remarkable contribution that Mr. Vieira de Mello made to the principles and purposes of the United Nations throughout his long career as an outstanding international civil servant.
132. In 2003, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization assisted some 51 countries through integrated programmes and country service frameworks for industrial development. 
The aim was to improve industrial governance and institutional infrastructure, strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, upgrade technological capacity, enhance skills and access to modern technology, build trade and export capability and adopt energy-efficient and cleaner production measures.
93. In Darfur, Sudan, massive human rights violations, including forced displacement, extrajudicial killings and gender-based sexual violence, combined with a lack of access to food and water, have left the majority of the population struggling to survive. 
The World Food Programme has been providing food assistance, while the United Nations Children's Fund has begun constructing and rehabilitating water systems. 
The World Health Organization has established a system for early warning to respond to outbreaks of disease and, together with UNICEF, is supporting health facilities and other field activities. 
In addition, my Emergency Relief Coordinator and the investigative missions of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have raised the profile of this humanitarian emergency and human rights crisis by briefing the Security Council and holding several high-level meetings with donors and agencies.
90. Coping with the issue of security in the field, for both refugees and humanitarian personnel, has remained a constant challenge. 
Over the past year there have been a number of direct attacks against humanitarian personnel. 
Such incidents are often intrinsically linked to the security environment for refugees themselves. 
In February 2004, more than 200 people were killed in an attack on a camp for displaced persons in northern Uganda. 
More recently there have been incursions from the Sudan into refugee-populated areas in eastern Chad, where various armed groups are also present. 
The presence of armed elements in refugee camps and settlements creates a dangerous environment for humanitarian personnel and also has grave consequences for the security and welfare of refugees, including violence and forced recruitment. 
In June 2004, UNHCR hosted a meeting of experts in Geneva on the issue of maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum. 
The meeting brought together the various parts of the United Nations system, including the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, a number of international non-governmental organizations and interested Governments. 
Participants took stock of lessons learned from the successful process of separating Liberian combatants from refugees in Sierra Leone in 2003, which may be applicable to future cases. 
A set of operational guidelines, including standards and procedures for the separation of armed elements from refugee populations, will follow later this year.
40. The United Nations continues to work on enhancing its institutional capacity for conflict prevention and peacemaking. 
In response to General Assembly resolution 57/337 of 3 July 2003 on the prevention of armed conflict, the United Nations system has increased its assistance to Member States in building national capacity for the prevention of conflict.
Country teams have started to better integrate such assistance into their programmes. 
United Nations agencies and departments, acting under the auspices of the Inter-agency/Interdepartmental Framework for Coordination, have also assisted a growing number of Member States, at their request, in building the capacity and skills of institutions, government and civil society for ensuring the peaceful settlement of disputes and enhancing sustainable development and social cohesion, including the consolidation of democratic governance.
5. An unprecedented Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 spread death and destruction over 14 countries on two continents. 
The disaster confirmed a disturbing trend during the past decade: the number of people killed by natural disasters has increased by almost 50 per cent. 
The outpouring of support from Governments, civil society, the private sector and individuals and the quick mobilization of resources set a new standard for humanitarian response. 
I hope that the global outpouring of solidarity and generosity will become a model for the response to other ongoing or future humanitarian crises.
17. Lebanon became a focus of international attention following the adoption of Security Council resolution 1559 (2004) in September and the shocking bomb attack that killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 20 others in Beirut in February 2005. 
I designated a Special Envoy for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1559 (2004), which called, among other things, for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country and the disbanding and disarmament of militias. 
A team of military experts I dispatched to Lebanon at the end of April concluded to the best of its ability that Syrian military assets, except in one disputed border area, had been withdrawn fully from Lebanon. 
I sent the team back in June to clarify allegations that Syrian intelligence operatives continued to operate in the country.
19. Turning to Africa, there was a major breakthrough in the Sudan with the signing on 9 January of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM). 
The accord ended two decades of North-South fighting that had killed and uprooted millions of people. 
During the negotiations, my Special Adviser provided support to the parties and to the mediation by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). 
The agreement permitted the United Nations Mission in the Sudan to be established, replacing the United Nations Advance Mission in the Sudan, which had been created in June 2004 to prepare for the anticipated peacekeeping operation as well as to provide further support to the parties in the final months leading up to the signing of the Peace Agreement. 
While attending the historic swearing-in of the new Government of National Unity on 9 July in Khartoum, I was encouraged that the two former adversaries, President Omer Hassan A. Al-Bashir and First Vice-President John Garang, pledged to seek wider political participation in the interim Government as well as to pursue peace and reconciliation in the regions of the Sudan that remained wracked by instability and conflict. 
The tragic and untimely death of First Vice-President Garang just three weeks later on 30 July was a terrible loss for the Sudan. 
However, since that date, I have been greatly reassured by the speed with which SPLM named Dr. Garang's successor, Commander Salva Kiir, as the head of the Movement and his subsequent inauguration as the First Vice-President of the Sudan. 
Crucially, both parties have quickly and authoritatively reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. 
38. Meanwhile, in seven countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia - Ecuador, Ghana, Guyana, Kenya, Namibia, Yemen and Zimbabwe - a joint programme of the Department of Political Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was actively helping Governments, political parties and members of civil society to acquire the skills they need to resolve disputes peacefully before they lead to violence. 
Separately, my Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide worked to develop a system for early warning of situations potentially involving massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
50. United Nations peacekeepers were able to take a more robust approach towards protecting civilians after the Security Council, in October 2004, authorized the deployment of 5,900 additional troops and civilian police to reinforce the Mission's military and security capacity. 
Combined military and political pressure resulted in the disarmament of 14,000 militiamen in the Ituri district. 
Regrettably, 11 peacekeepers were killed in the line of duty.
102. At its forty-third session, held in New York from 9 to 18 February 2005, the Commission for Social Development reviewed progress in implementing the commitments of the World Summit for Social Development over the past 10 years, including global performance in promoting full and productive employment. 
Various United Nations system entities are working on such projects as making employment part of United Nations country programming processes in developing countries, fighting rural unemployment and helping with the development of skills. 
The Youth Employment Network, which I launched in 2001 in partnership with the heads of the World Bank and ILO, has been promoting the preparation of national action plans for youth employment in an increasing number of countries.
133. At the regional level, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific has continued to support the most vulnerable countries through a variety of activities, such as the regional poverty alleviation programme, its project of strengthening national capabilities in poverty alleviation and conflict negotiation skills, an advocacy project on multisectoral responses to fight HIV/AIDS in Asia, capacity-building for effective participation in the multilateral trading system and external debt management. 
152. The largest number of returns last year occurred in Afghanistan with more than 940,000 refugees alone returning home. 
Economic improvements and successful elections reinforced interventions to ensure the reintegration of more than 4.1 million refugees and internally displaced people who had returned home since the end of 2001. 
Mine-action programmes continue to facilitate return and the delivery of assistance by opening vital routes into communities at risk. 
Using a community-based approach to ensure local support, UNICEF has been addressing the particular needs of returning child soldiers. 
More than 4,000 underage soldiers have been demobilized and reintegrated into their communities through programmes combining informal education, skills training and psycho-social support. 
Despite progress, however, an estimated 160,000 people remain displaced in Afghanistan owing to insecurity or drought in their place of origin. 
An estimated 1 million Afghans remain in the Islamic Republic of Iran, while another 960,600 are living in camps in Pakistan. 
According to a February 2005 Government census, an additional 1.9 million Afghans are living in urban areas in Pakistan, some of whom may be refugees. 
170. The incidence and severity of disasters associated with natural hazards continues to increase. 
According to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, more than 246,000 people were killed between April 2004 and April 2005 as a result of natural disasters.
Another 157 million were injured, displaced or otherwise adversely affected. 
An estimated $100 billion worth of property damage also occurred, which in many countries eroded hard-won development gains. 
Ongoing climate change, environmental degradation, unplanned urbanization and mitigation systems that do not adequately address those factors are the likely cause of the increase in both the incidence and the severity of disasters.
Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.
(b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army;
(c) To kill or wound an enemy who, having laid down his arms, or having no longer means of defence, has surrendered at discretion;
C. Military and security training including the provision of expertise, knowledge or skill in the use of such weapons, munitions, sub-components and sensitive technologies. 
B. Any provision by one or more persons to another in a different jurisdiction of expertise, knowledge or skill in the use of arms as defined in Article 1 above. 
V. Human rights, democracy and good governance
24. We will spare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the rule of law, as well as respect for all internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development.
to respect fully and uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
to strengthen the capacity of all our countries to implement the principles and practices of democracy and respect for human rights, including minority rights.
to take measures to ensure respect for and protection of the human rights of migrants, migrant workers and their families, to eliminate the increasing acts of racism and xenophobia in many societies and to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all societies.
Believing that the primary task of all States and international organizations is to eliminate from the life of society all evils and obstacles to social progress, particularly such evils as inequality, exploitation, war, colonialism and racism, 
Seeing that, even if it is not possible at present to concert measures applicable to all circumstances which may in practice occur, it is nevertheless undeniably advantageous to frame, as far as possible, rules of general application to meet the case where war has unfortunately broken out;
The link between poverty and civil war
to take concerted action against international terrorism, and to accede as soon as possible to all the relevant international conventions.
B. Preventing catastrophic terrorism

(ii) Conclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism before the end of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly;
GOAL: To take concerted action against international terrorism and to accede as soon as possible to all the relevant international conventions

Bearing in mind the results of the Ministerial Conference on Terrorism, held in Paris on 30 July 1996, and the recommendations that it made,
115. Further resolve to take concerted action against international terrorism, which causes serious obstacles to sustainable development.
Bearing in mind the results of the Ministerial Conference on Terrorism, held in Paris on 30 July 1996, and the recommendations that it made,

(b) When the committee votes by mechanical means, a non-recorded vote shall replace a vote by show of hands or by standing and a recorded vote shall replace a roll-call vote. 
10. The Secretariat should facilitate informal consultations by providing adequate conference services.
The foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be, rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism. 
to grant more generous development assistance, especially to countries that are genuinely making an effort to apply their resources to poverty reduction.
The Department of Public Information, with assistance from the Office of Internal Oversight Services, will, over a three-year period, conduct a systematic evaluation of the impact and cost-effectiveness of all of its activities.
Promulgated strengthened rules to ensure protection against retaliation for those who report misconduct through a new "whistleblower" protection policy.
(k) The information and communications (ICT) systems underpinning our management of human resources do not meet the stringent demands imposed by the global reach of today's United Nations;
19. Secretariat reporting mechanisms should be improved, including through the development of a single, comprehensive annual report, and the 30 existing reports on management should be consolidated into six reports.
Deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing countries through national and international measures in order to make debt sustainable in the long term
Over the past two years, UNDP has actively promoted the concept of sustainable human development. 
It has supported almost 40 countries in Africa, Asia, the Arab States, Latin America and Europe in a national effort to review development plans through disaggregated data and analysis of disadvantaged groups and regions. 
To those countries, the Programme has also recommended multidisciplinary strategies linking human development priorities to environmental, economic, social and political sustainability. 
Such strategies include building partnerships between government and civil society and building consensus on development priorities and goals; 
they have also served as a vehicle for coordinating United Nations system support for country planning. 
UNDP is currently orienting its cooperation at all levels - global, interregional, national and subnational - to ensure support for substantive human development. 
to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and 
to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and 
To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace; 
The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.
Membership in the United Nations is open to a other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations.
The General Assembly may call the attention of the Security Council to situations which are likely to endanger international peace and security.
